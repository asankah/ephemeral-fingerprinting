# Ephemeral Fingerprinting On The Web

## Background

TL;DR:

*   Any ephemeral low-entropy web observable property whose changes are
    concurrently observable by multiple sites can lead to cross site identity
    joining.

*   This method of identity joining does not require coordination between
    multiple first parties. A single third party embedded within multiple first
    parties can also use this method.

![diagram of site isolation boundaries with overlap](images/isolation-boundaries.png)

**Example 1**:  Two sites observe a sequence of device orientation changes at
times ùíï‚ÇÄ, ùíï‚ÇÅ,ùíï‚ÇÇ.

All sites on the same UA instance share a clock and therefore can agree on
the timestamps with a small margin of error. The triplet ùíï‚ÇÄ, ùíï‚ÇÅ,ùíï‚ÇÇ has a
high probability of uniquely identifying the user.

Signals considered for ephemeral fingerprinting may not be highly identifying
by themselves. The [privacy budget
proposal](https://github.com/bslassey/privacy-budget) does not adequately
account for fingerprinting based on concurrent observations of low entropy
signals.

Device orientation, from our earlier example, can take one of two values
(portrait or landscape), and is unstable. Thus a single sample of device
orientation carries almost no information. I.e. Normalized Mutual Information
(NMI) between the user and the device orientation reading is approximately
zero. However timestamps corresponding to orientation changes could have
identifying levels of entropy.

_One or more low entropy signals observed concurrently can be used to
identify a user with a high degree of confidence. _Let‚Äôs call these
**_ephemeral fingerprints_**. This document discusses two types:

1. _The sequence of timestamps ‚Äî possibly coarse ‚Äî of a volatile surface can
be used for identification_. Let‚Äôs call these **correlated events**.

1. _A stream of observations of a volatile surface can be identifying_. Let‚Äôs
call these **unique event streams**.

These are not new. For example, this is discussed by Van Goethem et. al.
<sup>[\[1\]](#van-goethem)</sup>
who calls these ‚ÄúCross-Session Events‚Äù (¬ß 5 of linked paper). Potential
ephemeral fingerprinting surfaces also get flagged during standardization
discussions (
[Example: Polling enumerateDevices](https://github.com/w3c/mediacapture-main/issues/403),
[Example: Ambient light events](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-privacy/2013JanMar/0007.html)).

### Other Examples

*   `Accelerometer` properties.
*   `Sensor`, `onreading` event.
*   `BatteryManager.onlevelchange` : Deprecated but still shipping.
*   `Bluetooth.onadvertisementreceived`
*   `BroadcastChannel`, all events.
*   `MediaDevices.devicechange` event.
*   `GlobalEventHandlers.onfocus` and `onblur` events can fire simultaneously when switching between two browser windows.

# Mitigations

### Permissions

**Goal:** Require informed consent from users.

There‚Äôs precedent for considering permissions
<sup>[\[2\]](#permission-methods)</sup> to be sufficient mitigation for
similar issues. For example, the Media Capture API specification includes the
following:

> For origins to which permission has been granted, the devicechange event will
> be emitted across browsing contexts and origins each time a new media device
> is added or removed; user agents can mitigate the risk of correlation of
> browsing activity across origins by fuzzing the timing of these events.

<p style="text-align: right">
From ¬ß15 of <a href="https://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-main/#privacy-and-security-considerations">Media Capture and Streams API</a> specification.</p>

**Pros**

*   Prevents drive-by fingerprinting.

**Cons**

*   UI for permissions don‚Äôt disclose the fact that all sites that have been
    granted access to the same resource can synchronize identifiers as a
    side-effect.

*   Doesn‚Äôt prevent identity joining once permission is granted.

### Fuzzing Timing of Events

**Goal**: Deter correlation of events by injecting timing skew.

Mentioned in the snippet above from the Media Capture and Streams API and
called out by Jeffrey Yasskin as a potential general mitigation in
‚Äúdesynchronize whole-browser events‚Äù in
[this issue](https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/5215) filed against the
WHATWG HTML specification.

**Pros**

*   Lowers confidence of identity equivalence.

**Cons**

*   Precise timing may not be required. I.e. the lowered level of confidence
    could still be sufficient for most uses.

*   Doesn‚Äôt address unique event streams.

### First-Party Restriction for APIs

**Goal**: Deter identity correlation by third-party sites. 

Restrict APIs to the origin of the [top-level browsing context].

[top-level browsing context]: https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsers.html#top-level-browsing-context

The latter may choose to explicitly delegate access to the APIs via [feature
policies]. But third-party contexts can‚Äôt ‚Äúreach across‚Äù browsing contexts
via correlation of cross context events or attributes that may be made
available by the API.

[feature policies]: https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-feature-policy/

**Pros**

*   Makes it a requirement that first-parties actively cooperate with other
    first-parties or third-parties. I.e. Good first-party + bad third-party =
    safe.

**Cons**

*   Difficult to retrofit into existing APIs.

*   Browser-wide events and attributes are still visible to distinct top-level
    browsing contexts.

*   In practice top-level browsing contexts contain a fair amount of third party
    scripts which may access the same APIs. Furthermore there are financial
    incentives for first-parties to delegate API access to third-parties.

### Limit API Access To Visible Browsing Contexts

**Goal:** Prevent background browsing contexts from skimming identifiable events.

The Page Visibility API defines the [visibility state of a document] as
`visible` if the document is _‚Äúat least partially visible on at least one
screen‚Äù_.

[visibility state of a document]: https://w3c.github.io/page-visibility/#visibility-states

Restrict APIs to ‚Äî possibly top-level ‚Äî browsing context‚Äôs active document.

**Pros**

*   Is a convincing mitigation on mobile devices where only one top-level
    document can be visible at the same time.

**Cons**

*   There could be multiple visible browsing contexts which still leaves the door
    open for identity correlation across site boundaries.

*   The fact that having more than one browsing context open at the same time is
    a privacy risk is quite surprising for users.

### Limit Events To Focused Top-Level Browsing Context

**Goal**: Limit firing correlatable events to a single [top-level browsing context].

The HTML spec defines a concept of a _[currently focused area of a top-level
browsing context]_. As defined, every top level [browsing context] has one
regardless of visibility. A similar narrow concept could be introduced that
recognizes the top level browsing context that has system input focus. There
should be only one of these on a single device.

[currently focused area of a top-level browsing context]: https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/interaction.html#currently-focused-area-of-a-top-level-browsing-context

[browsing context]: https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsers.html#browsing-context

_Let‚Äôs call the top-level browsing context that has system input focus as the_ **focused top-level browsing context**.

New specifications could restrict browser-wide events to the focused
top-level browsing context.

**Pros**

*   Likely fits in well with the intended usage model for most APIs.

**Cons**

*   Does not address event stream fingerprinting via polling.

### Limit API Access To Focused Top-Level Browsing Context

**Goal**: Limit access to sensitive APIs to a single [top-level browsing context].

Similar to the above, but addresses issues around polling by disallowing
access to the entire API or sensitive attributes by restricting the entire
API instead of just events.

**Pros**

*   Resilient to event stream fingerprinting via polling.

**Cons**

*   Can‚Äôt be easily retrofitted to existing APIs since it requires defining
    behavior for ‚Äúdisabled‚Äù APIs.

*   May break critical use cases.

### Secure-Context Restriction and Control via Feature-Policy

These should be pretty standard at this point.

**Pros**

*   Just makes sense.

**Cons**

*   Not sufficient by itself.


# Spotting Ephemeral Fingerprinting Surfaces In Web Specs

**Ephemeral fingerprints:**

*   Require that multiple browsing contexts observe the same events or access the
    same volatile attribute.

*   These browsing contexts could involve a single third party in multiple first
    party contexts.

*   Does not require precise clocks nor agreement on the exact timestamps of the
    observed events. Depending on the fingerprintable surfaces involved the
    sequence of events could be identifiable by itself. Servers can roughly
    bucket observations by time periods, eliminating the need for client-side
    clocks.

*   Does not require an API to fire an event. A property with a volatile value
    that can be polled periodically is sufficient.


### What to look for:

*   Events with external triggers. E.g. hardware based events.

*   Multiple distinct events that are fired in tandem to distinct browsing
    contexts. E.g. any processing model where multiple events are fired.

*   Volatile attributes that are visible across browsing contexts.

*   Volatile attributes that don‚Äôt share values across browsing contexts, but
    change simultaneously. E.g. Salting a volatile attribute is insufficient if
    its mutations can be correlated.

### Example

Consider `onfocus` and `onblur` events.

The [focus update steps] involve firing up to three distinct events: `change`
if the node losing focus is an `input` element, `focus`, and `blur`.

[focus update steps]: https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/interaction.html#focus-update-steps

When focus traverses a browsing context boundary, these events may be fired
simultaneously to two different browsing contexts. Browsers mitigate this by
not firing `blur` for cross site tab switches, but they still fire `blur`
when the browser itself goes out of focus. Thus identity can be correlated
when switching browser windows.

#### Possible Mitigation

When the _new chain_ and the _old chain_<sup>[\[3\]](#chains)</sup> are in
different top-level browsing contexts whose active documents are not
same-origin, queue but don‚Äôt fire `change` and `blur` events until focus
returns to the old top-level browsing context.
